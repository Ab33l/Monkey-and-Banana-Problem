# Monkey-and-Banana-Problem

In the problem, there is a monkey in a room with a box and a banana. The monkey is on the floor at the door, the box is on the floor at the window and the banana is hanging from the roof in the middle of the room. The monkey cannot reach the banana until he moves the box close to the banana (so as to grasp and reach it), then climbs the box and gets the banana.
